### Pretest: CuteRectangle Design Generator

#### Overview of the study

In a pretest, we intended to show that Kindchenschema can deliver the meaning of cuteness in the predicted direction when converted to factors of normative aesthetics. Participants were asked to design an appearance of a rectangle by adjusting the five dimensions of Kindchenschema. We predicted that the “cute” rectangles would be (a) smaller, (b) rounder, (c)lighter, (d) tilted, and (e) wider.

#### Participants

229 students from a Midwestern university in the U.S.A. (Mage = 20.04, 47.2% Female) voluntarily participated in a five-minute “cute rectangle design task” in a computer lab. The participants were recruited via course announcements and were compensated with a course credit for their participation.

### Main test: Perception of shapes, Evaluation

#### Overview of the study

In this study, we examined whether the evaluation of Kindchenschema is different across cultures or not. We showed participants a series of rectangles with Kindchenschema and measured the perceived meaning of the rectangles. It is hypothesized that the identical cute rectangles would be perceived differently, according to the participants’ cultural self-construal.  

#### Methods: Instrument/ Participants

To test whether participants’ cultural self-construals affect the perception of the same visual stimuli, participants from the U.S.A., South Korea, and Estonia were recruited to represent Western, Eastern, and Euro-Russian cultures, respectively. A total of 228 volunteers completed the online survey; 159 Americans (45% males, Mage=22.69yrs, SD=6.17, range 18-72), 35 Estonians (20% males, Mage=26.63yrs, SD=8.04, range 19-65), 34 Koreans (11% males, Mage=30.24yrs, SD=11.09, range 21-62). 

32 rectangular images from the pretest were selected by their extreme z-scores in each dimension, such that each rectangle would represent either High(H) or low(L) levels of the five Kindchenschema dimensions (HHHHH to LLLLL: light(H)-dark(L), wide(H)-narrow(L), tilted(H)-straight(L), round(H)-sharp(L) corner, and small(H)-large(L), Folder "MainStudy-Stimuli-32rec" contains the 32 rectagles selected.

The dependent variables included scales that measured the perceived cuteness of rectangles (anchored with not_at_all_cute vs. cute) and nine additional semantic differential scales (Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1957) as follows in 7 scales; positive–negative, weak–strong, active–passive, feminine–masculine, friendly–hostile, unlikable–likable, silly–sensible, cold–warm, and unattractive–attractive. The word pairs were presented to the participants in a randomized order.
